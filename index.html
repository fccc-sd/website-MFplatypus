            <p>
             My name is Bonjourjohnson I have one brother and one sister and I am the middle child in my family of five. I have a dog named Rousey and used
              to have a cat named Oreo as well as a bearded dragon named steve. I have a friend named Elliot who also had a bearded dragon but hers 
              was a lot bigger than mine. My other friends like to play video games and golf and do much more but to summarize, there is jaxson he 
              likes the Houston texans and loves to play football and geometry dash (which in foresight is a weird combo). There is also Dawson who 
              is a hard core gamer and he has a very big family, he is a little smaller than me and has red hair and glasses most of the time.

            <p>
              In my free time I like to do a lot of things like running swimming basketball and more. I am usally busy with a certain type of sport 
              throught the year wether it be <em>golf</em>, <em>track</em> or a new one i've picked up <em>boxing</em>. I really like to write as 
              well and I love poetry I've also recently have tried to <em>read</em> but I am an extremly slow reader so I mostly listen to audio 
              books. I go to my Grandpa often he works a lot of golf with me but I also like to <em>fish</em> at his house I mostly top fly fish. 
              I like to cook and make food on top of more physical activities I tried to <em>cook</em> salmon and enchilades.

            <p>
             The first interesting thing about me is I hate cats and it started with this fat cat at my grandma's house who scratched me on the 
              forhead and my relashionship with them has been all down hill since. My favorite color is yellow but thats only because it's like 
              nobody's favorite color. Even before trying to learn how to box, professional fighting has always been an interest of mine I love 
              watching Dimtry Bivol Issac Cruz or Marios Barrios. Platypuses are my favorite animale just because of how weird they are I mean 
              there are only 1 of 2 mammals to lay eggs and on top of that they produce pink milk and <span>glow in blue light for some reason.
              </span>I really like history when I moved from my home school to four county I was sort of bummed out that you guys didn't have a
              history class.
