        <h2>Video Games</h2> <!--a section about why I like video games and some of the ones i've been playing-->

        <p>
          I love playing video games because whenever I'm down I can just play until my hearts content. I love playing them also because 
          I am extremly competitive and love the team element of any sort of a game whether it be video or not. Normally when I am 
          playing it's with randoms but I still talk to them all the same and for good reason because I like to play the support role
          often. On occasion I play something single player or something that has a dueling mechanic. 
        </p>

        <h2>Boxing</h2>

        <p>
          I have only started to try and box recently and right now I can tell you I'm not very good however whether or not I do continue to box
          boxing will always be with me. I mean that in the sense of watching fights it's one of the few things me and my dad really can bond over.
          It is also something very inwined with my family and I mean that more in the family part and less in the fighting. when a fight comes 
          around we're always at someones house like my cousins or uncles it very much becomes an event and everyone is talking about technics and
          making fun of who they walk out with all and all its a good time. 
        </p>
